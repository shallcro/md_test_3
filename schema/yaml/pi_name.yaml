    The authority control for both personal and organizational names is the [Virtual International Authority File, or VIAF](https://viaf.org/), which links the various national authority files (that is, catalogs of authoritative names such as the [Library of Congress Name Authority File](https://authorities.loc.gov/)) into a single international collective. If a principal investigator does not have a VIAF record, another source is used to ensure their inputted name is accurate.
    
    For names of people: 
      
      * The First name can include any middle names or initials; the Last name can include any suffixes (such as 'II' or 'Jr.'). 
      
      * There is no space between first and middle initials.
      
      * Abbreviations are discouraged, especially 'et al.'  'Sr.' and 'Jr.' are allowed.  

    For studies that are part of an ICPSR series, PIs remain consistent with the way the same PIs are listed in the previous series studies.
