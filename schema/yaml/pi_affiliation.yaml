    The authority control for organizational names is the [Virtual International Authority File, or VIAF](https://viaf.org/), which links the various national authority files (that is, catalogs of authoritative names such as the [Library of Congress Name Authority File](https://authorities.loc.gov/)) into a single international collective. If a principal investigator does not have a VIAF record, another source is used to ensure their inputted name is accurate.
    
    For names of organizations:
      
      * If an organizational affiliation for a person is not know, 'Unknown' is listed in that principal investigator's (PI's) Organization.

      * If the list of PIs includes multiple people affiliated with the same organization, that organization is repeated for each person.

      * For organizational PIs, the higher level of an organization should be listed before the lower level, and levels should be separated by a period (e.g.,'University of Michigan. College of Literature, Science, and the Arts'). There is no period following the last level listed.

      * Abbreviations are discouraged, except 'Inc.' and 'Co.' In particular, governmental PI's are spelled out completely (e.g., 'United States Department of Commerce' rather than 'U.S. Dept. of Commerce').

      * 'The' is not included at the start of an organization name unless it is actually part of the official name (e.g., 'The New York Times' but not 'The National Institute of Justice').

    For studies that are part of an ICPSR series, PIs remain consistent with the way the same PIs are listed in the previous series studies.
