  usageNotes: |
    The inclusion of a common scale should be identified in the documentation associated with this dataset and confirmed by variable names or labels.  

    The scales can be cited either as a list or described in full sentences. 

    If the questionnaire used has a finite list of responses (e.g., 'Always, Sometimes, Rarely, Never' or Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly Disagree'), it is acceptable for this field to note 'A Likert-type scale was used,' or 'Several Likert-type scales were used.' However, especially in situations where only Likert-type Scales were used, it is not required.
