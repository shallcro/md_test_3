<h2 id="1-version-required"><a name="version"></a>1. Version         [Required]</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The current version number for the data collection.</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: <code>integer</code></p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> Version numbers are integers without leading zeros. Versioning begins when a data collection is first archived. Each subsequent update of the data collection increments the version number by 1. The version number is incremented when modifying or adding:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Data files, including additions of datasets or supplemental data files, additional masking, increasing curation level, or resupplied datasets  </li>
<li>Documentation files  </li>
<li>SDA (Survey Documentation and Analysis) files  </li>
</ul>
<p>Metadata-only updates to the data collection do not increment the version number. Changes to the version number require a textual summary to be added to Changes to Collection.  </p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> </p>
<pre><code class="language-json">1

<p><strong>Type</strong>: <code>string</code></p>
<p><strong>Format</strong>: <code>date</code></p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> ICPSR automatically generates this date for data collection additions and updates. For metadata-only updates, the date remains unchanged.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> </p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;2006-03-30&quot;

<p><strong>Type</strong>: <code>string</code></p>
<p><strong>Format</strong>: <code>date</code></p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> ICPSR automatically generates the release date.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> </p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;2001-02-07&quot;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;2020-08-12&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="4-study-title-required"><a name="study_title"></a>4. Study Title         [Required]</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The authoritative title of the data collection. A full title should include a descriptive string that captures what the data collection contains as well as the geographic scope of and the time period covered by the data collection.</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: <code>string</code></p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> The Study Title includes three essential parts: the title proper, the geography, and the time period.  </p>
<p>Title Proper:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The title proper is a descriptive string that captures what the data collection contains.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The title proper uses title case: all major words are capitalized, while minor words are lowercased.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For new studies, ICPSR starts with the title proper provided by the principal investigator. Most title propers are straightforward about their contents, such as the 'American Community Survey' or the 'Census of Law Enforcement Training Academies.' Some title propers include a more branded description, such as 'Bridge of Faith: Aim4Peace Community-Based Violence Prevention Project or Contents' and 'Contexts of Cyberbullying: An Epidemiologic Study using Electronic Detection and Social Network Analysis.'  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Geography:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All titles include the data collection's geographic coverage. If the geographic coverage is already included in the title proper, it is not repeated.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cities are paired with state or province names that are spelled out (e.g., Portland, Oregon), unless the city names are unique or well-known.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Studies with more than four geographic locations typically are summarized using, for example, '5 countries,' '8 German cities,' '20 U.S. states' instead of listing all locations.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When listing multiple U.S. cites or states, 'U.S.' is used rather than 'United States' or 'American' (e.g., '5 U.S. states').  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Descriptors that do not have a distinct geographic area, such as 'communities' or 'regions', are not included in titles.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If 'National,' 'American', 'Congressional' or 'Federal' is in the title, add '[United States]' (or, in rare situations, the appropriate other country) in brackets.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Time Period:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All titles include the data collection's time period, which reflects the time period that the data collection covers and should match the Study Time Period. For example, in the 'Uganda Elite Study, 1964-1968', it is assumed that the Ugandans were surveyed about events in 1964-1968, even if the actual data collection might not have taken place until later.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the time period is already included in the title proper, it is not repeated.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For most studies, a single year or range of years is acceptable. Years are written as four digits, including when used in a range (e.g., '1999', '2001-2003', or '1999, 2010, 2015').  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Months are included only when part of ICPSR series that have multiple releases, which are otherwise identical, each year. In these cases, months are spelled out (e.g., 'September 2020' instead of '9/2020' or 'Sept. 2020').  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For updated studies, ICPSR uses the existing title in production, making changes as necessary to add new years or additional geographical locations. For studies that are part of an ICPSR series, titles remain consistent with the previous series studies.  </p>
<p><strong>Curator Notes:</strong> ICPSR staff are empowered to change the dates in approved titles without metadata librarian approval when the data supports the change. Geography changes should be submitted for approval.    </p>

<h4 id="811-name"><a name="principal_investigators_items_name"></a>8.1.1. Name</h4>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The name of the entity primarily responsible for the data collection.</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: <code>string</code></p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> ICPSR utilizes VIAF (<a href="https://viaf.org/">https://viaf.org/</a>) as its authority control source. The ICPSR Personal Names Authority List (<a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10002">https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10002</a>) and Organizational Names Authority List (<a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10004">https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10004</a>) can also be used, especially for organization names.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> The authority control for both personal and organizational names is the <a href="https://viaf.org/">Virtual International Authority File, or VIAF</a>, which links the various national authority files (that is, catalogs of authoritative names such as the <a href="https://authorities.loc.gov/">Library of Congress Name Authority File</a>) into a single international collective. If a principal investigator does not have a VIAF record, another source is used to ensure their inputted name is accurate.  </p>
<p>For names of people:   </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The First name can include any middle names or initials; the Last name can include any suffixes (such as 'II' or 'Jr.').   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no space between first and middle initials.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abbreviations are discouraged, especially 'et al.'  'Sr.' and 'Jr.' are allowed.    </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For studies that are part of an ICPSR series, PIs remain consistent with the way the same PIs are listed in the previous series studies.    </p>
<p><strong>Curator Notes:</strong> Years are not indicated when listing individual PIs, even if VIAF uses them to disambiguate between same-named PIs.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> The organization with which an individual PI was affiliated at the time of a data collection's publication.</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: <code>string</code></p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> ICPSR utilizes VIAF (<a href="http://viaf.org/">http://viaf.org/</a>) as its authority control source. The ICPSR Organization Names Authority List (<a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10004">https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10004</a>) may also be used for Organization names.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> The authority control for organizational names is the <a href="https://viaf.org/">Virtual International Authority File, or VIAF</a>, which links the various national authority files (that is, catalogs of authoritative names such as the <a href="https://authorities.loc.gov/">Library of Congress Name Authority File</a>) into a single international collective. If a principal investigator does not have a VIAF record, another source is used to ensure their inputted name is accurate.  </p>
<p>For names of organizations:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If an organizational affiliation for a person is not know, 'Unknown' is listed in that principal investigator's (PI's) Organization.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the list of PIs includes multiple people affiliated with the same organization, that organization is repeated for each person.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For organizational PIs, the higher level of an organization should be listed before the lower level, and levels should be separated by a period (e.g.,'University of Michigan. College of Literature, Science, and the Arts'). There is no period following the last level listed.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abbreviations are discouraged, except 'Inc.' and 'Co.' In particular, governmental PI's are spelled out completely (e.g., 'United States Department of Commerce' rather than 'U.S. Dept. of Commerce').  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'The' is not included at the start of an organization name unless it is actually part of the official name (e.g., 'The New York Times' but not 'The National Institute of Justice').  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For studies that are part of an ICPSR series, PIs remain consistent with the way the same PIs are listed in the previous series studies.  </p>

<h2 id="14-summary-required"><a name="summary"></a>14. Summary         [Required]</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A full description or abstract of the data collection's subject matter or intellectual content. The main goal of the Summary is to give the user a clear sense of what the collection is about, including the purpose of the collection, the major topics covered, and what questions the principal investigators attempted to answer when they conducted the data collection.</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: <code>string</code></p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> The main goal of the Summary is to give the reader a clear sense of what the data collection is about, including substantive information about the different parts of the data collection not adequately conveyed by the Fileset names or found elsewhere in the metadata.   </p>
<p>A listing of major variables or categories of variables with a few examples is also important. It is also salient to indicate the unit of analysis for the data collection, i.e., who or what is being studied: individuals, housing units, courts, criminal acts, etc. Most often the unit of analysis is the individual; where it is not, it is particularly important to make this clear.  </p>
<p>The Summary is written in the third person and avoids attempting to address issues of how the data might be used, who might be interested in the data, or any evaluative comments about the worth or usefulness of the data collection. The Summary uses past tense when describing the process of collecting the data and present tense when necessary, such as when describing the data (e.g., 'The MIDUS Refresher collection is split into two datasets.'). Numerals are used instead of spelling them out; if a number is spelled out for emphasis, the number is attached in parentheses (e.g. 'Two thousand (2,000)').  </p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> </p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;In 2014, Chicago Public Schools, looking to reduce the possibility of gun violence among school-aged youth, applied for a grant through the National Institute of Justice. CPS was awarded the Comprehensive School Safety Initiative grant and use said grant to establish the 'Connect and Redirect to Respect' program. This program used student social media data to identify and intervene with students thought to be at higher risk for committing violence. At-risk behaviors included brandishing a weapon, instigating conflict online, signaling gang involvement, and threats towards others. Identified at-risk students would be contacted by a member of the CPS Network Safety Team or the Chicago Police Department's Gang School Safety Team, depending on the risk level of the behavior. To evaluate the efficacy of CRR, the University of Chicago Crime Lab compared outcomes for students enrolled in schools that received the program to outcomes for students enrolled in comparison schools, which did not receive the program. 32 schools were selected for the study, with a total of 44,503 students. Demographic variables included age, race, sex, and ethnicity. Misconduct and academic variables included arrest history, in-school suspensions, out-of-school suspensions, GPA, and attendance days.&quot;

<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;The Health and Relationship Project is a study of both spouses in same-sex and different-sex marriages who were legally married and aged 35 to 65 at the time of data collection (2015). There are two parts of this study: a baseline questionnaire and a daily diary questionnaire completed for 10 consecutive days; both components were completed online and spouses were asked to complete the surveys separately. The baseline questionnaire asks participants about a number of topics related to marriage and health, including stress, health status and health behaviors, relationship quality, and how they have approached health problems in the past. The diary questionnaire asks participants a number of questions about the past 24 hours, including daily stress experiences, social interactions, and health behaviors.&quot;

<h2 id="15-subject-terms-required"><a name="subject_terms"></a>15. Subject Terms         [Required]</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A controlled list of terms used for indexing purposes to indicate what topics a data collection reflects. Subject Terms serve to increase the collection's discoverability by topic.</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: <code>array of string</code></p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> Values from the ICPSR Subject Terms Thesaurus (<a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10001">https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10001</a>) and the ICPSR Personal Names Authority List (<a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10002">https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10002</a>) are preferred. Non-thesaurus terms are considered for inclusion if provided.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> The Library of Congress Subject Terms (<a href="https://authorities.loc.gov">https://authorities.loc.gov</a>) is referenced when adding new terms to the ICPSR Subject Thesaurus.</p>
<p><strong>Curator Notes:</strong> Non-thesaurus terms can be submitted in the metadata editor and will be reviewed by the metadata librarian. If an ICPSR staff member submits a non-thesaurus term, the metadata librarian will gauge the necessity of this term, check it against the Library of Congress Subject Headings to see if a different related term should be used, and consider it for addition to the ICPSR thesaurus.</p>

<h2 id="22-study-purpose-optional"><a name="study_purpose"></a>22. Study Purpose         [Optional]</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Describes the concept of the data collection in detail.</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: <code>string</code></p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> The Study Purpose provides more specific information than the Summary field, including the data collection's objectives, intended achievements, and lists of questions it sought to answer. This field can also include historical or background information about the research project. As with the Summary, the text should be written in third person and avoid any commentary on the data collection's outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> </p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;The purpose of this study is to advance understanding of the barriers and enablers associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) screening among Somali men ages 50-74 in Minnesota.&quot;
</code></pre>

</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;The purpose of the study was to explore the impact of interventions by Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners/Sexual Assault Response Teams (SANE/SART) on the judicial process. The goal of this study was to test the efficacy of SANE/SART programs as a tool in the criminal justice system. The American Prosecutors Research Institute and Boston College tested the hypotheses that SANE/SART exams increase arrest and prosecution rates. In testing this hypothesis, the project team sought to answer five primary research questions: (1) Is the arrest rate higher in cases where a SANE/SART exam is performed as compared with cases in which no exam is performed?, (2) Is the indictment/charging rate higher in such cases?, (3) Are guilty pleas more likely to be entered in such cases, and are pleas likely to be to the existing charge or to a lesser charge?, (4) Is the conviction rate higher in such cases?, and (5) Is the sentence more severe in such cases? In addition, the project team examined the participation of victims in the criminal justice process and the types of services that were offered them. As a large portion of SANE/SART programs focus on understanding victims' reactions to sexual assault and ensuring proper treatment to minimize the chance of further trauma, a central hypothesis to be tested was that improved case outcomes may be a result of increased participation by the victim in the identification, apprehension, and prosecution of the perpetrator. Moreover, the level of services offered and provided to victims, particularly those related to prosecution would likely affect case outcomes as well. Both the victim's participation in the criminal justice system and specifics of SANE/SART services, including evidence collection, were considered in determining the true impact of SANE/SART interventions on case outcomes.&quot;

<h2 id="23-study-design-optional"><a name="study_design"></a>23. Study Design         [Optional]</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Describes the procedures the researchers used to contact subjects and/or to collect the data.</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: <code>string</code></p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> The Study Design provides more detailed information than the Summary, including how surveys were prepared and administered, how interviews were conducted, or how the data were obtained and compiled, as well as information about deadlines and follow-ups to respondents.  </p>
<p><strong>Curator Notes:</strong> It is acceptable to summarize information contained in study documentation and point users to that study documentation for more details. If the Summary already contains text that would be appropriate in Study Design, it is acceptable to duplicate that text.  </p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> </p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;Data on organizational culture in each of the 12 courts (Part 1) were obtained by administering the Court Culture Assessment Instrument (CCAI) to all judges with a felony criminal court docket and to all senior court administrators. A total of 224 respondents completed the questionnaire. The CCAI was used to assess five key dimensions of current court culture orientation: (1) dominant case management style, (2) judicial and court staff relations, (3) change management, (4) courthouse leadership, and (5) internal organization. The determination of what culture judges and court administrators desired to establish in the near future was also obtained through the application of the same instrument (CACI) as practitioners were asked to indicate the type of culture in each work area (or content dimension) they would like to see in their court in the next five years. Additionally, surveys were conducted of prosecuting attorneys (Part 2) and public defender attorneys (Part 3) to gauge their views on how well the courts in which they practice achieve the goals of access, fairness, and managerial effectiveness. Every prosecutor and public defender with two years or more experience in representing the state or criminal defendants in felony cases was asked to complete a questionnaire probing their thoughts on how well their court acted to promote access to records through availability and staff cooperation, treating litigants, witnesses, jurors and others fairly, and demonstrating concern for the rights and interests of others in the criminal trial process, including attorney and victims. A total of 334 prosecuting attorneys and 260 public defense attorneys completed the 46-item trial court process survey.&quot;

<pre><code class="language-json">[
    &quot;The original National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Children and Young Adults 1979 (NLSY79) was a multi-stage, stratified random national sample. Sampling weights are available in the public-use datasets to adjust for minority oversamples and year-to-year attrition. There are mother and child specific weights. Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) were counties and independent cities. PSUs were stratified prior to sampling based on 9 Census divisions and 2 urban/rural classes.&quot;,
    &quot;The initial Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) combined two independent samples: a cross-sectional, national sample (based on stratified multistage selection of the civilian noninstitutional population of the U.S.) and a national sample of low-income families. The cross-section sample was an equal probability sample of households in the 48 coterminous states designed to yield about 3,000 completed interviews. The second sample was selected from the Census Bureau's Survey of Economic Opportunity (SEO) using unequal selection probabilities. &quot;

In some data collections, each kind of 'missing response' may be assigned the same code across all variables, e.g., 'inapplicable' cases may be coded -1 for all variables, 'don't know' may be coded -2, and 'no answer' may be coded -3. In other instances, standards may be specific to the type of variable involved, e.g., blanks may denote missing data for all alphabetic variables, codes -1, -2, and -3 may denote missing data for all dummy variables, and codes 7, 8, and 9 may represent missing data for all other variables. In yet other instances, standard codes may depend on the column width of each variable, e.g., 99 may denote 'no answer' for all two column variables and 999 may denote the same for all three column variables.</td>

It is acceptable to summarize information contained in documentation and refer users to that documentation for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Curator Notes:</strong> For NIJ studies, 'Not applicable.' should be used if no information is available. For all other archives, this field is optional.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> </p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;A weight variable with two implied decimal places has been included and must be used in any analysis.&quot;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;Both the TransPop and Cisgender datasets have the same variable named WEIGHT as the weighting variable. The combination datasets have a set of three weight variables (WEIGHT_TRANSPOP, WEIGHT_CISGENDER, WEIGHT_CISGENDER_TRANSPOP). The results will be representative of the sample when the weight is applied. Pages 41 and 42 of the user guide contain instructions that detail how to apply the final sample weight using Stata or SPSS.&quot;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;The 1996 NES dataset includes two final person-level analysis weights which incorporate sampling, nonresponse, and post-stratification factors. One weight (variable #4) is for longitudinal micro-level analysis using the 1996 NES Panel. The other weight (variable #3) is for analysis of the 1996 NES combined sample (Panel component cases plus Cross-section supplement cases). In addition, a Time Series Weight (variable #5) which corrects for Panel attrition was constructed. This weight should be used in analyses which compare the 1996 NES to earlier unweighted National Election Study data collections.&quot;

<p><strong>Curator Notes:</strong> When there are multiple subclassifications, the smallest (most detailed) one is chosen to represent the data collection. Each data collection must have at least one ICPSR classification, as well as a classification from the collection's home archive. Classifications can also be used to cross-list a study among multiple archives. Curators should choose the topical classifications that best match the study's focus.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong>  Identifies the grouping of files in a data collection. Every ICPSR data collection with at least one file must have at least one defined Fileset.</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: <code>array of object</code></p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> Filesets are used at ICPSR to make a convenient package for description, discovery, preservation and dissemination -- a package that is smaller than the data collection but larger than the individual file. A fileset typically contains a single file of statistical data plus additional files that support the data -- such as setups for statistical software, documentation, and alternative data representations. A data collection may have multiple filesets. Each Fileset has a Number, and may also have a Name and an SDA (Survey Documentation and Analysis) Note.</p>

<h4 id="3911-number"><a name="filesets_items_number"></a>39.1.1. Number</h4>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A number that uniquely identifies a 'part' or component file that is associated with the data collection.</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: <code>integer</code></p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> Fileset numbers are typically (but not always) consecutive integers beginning with 1. (In some cases, the number may be drawn from an external resource, such as FIPS state and county codes.) The numbers correspond to the 'part numbers' embedded in ICPSR standard filenames.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> A brief title used to distinguish each fileset within a data collection.</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: <code>string</code></p>
<p><strong>Controlled Vocabulary:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong> Fileset Names are required for data collections that include multiple Filesets. If a data collection includes only one fileset, a Fileset Name is not included. Fileset Names use title case (all main words are capitalized) and do not begin with articles (a, the) or dates.</p>
