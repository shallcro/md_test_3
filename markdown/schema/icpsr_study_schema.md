## <a name="version"></a>1. Version         [Required]

**Description:** The current version number for the data collection.

**Type**: `integer`

**Controlled Vocabulary:** N/A

**Usage Notes:** Version numbers are integers without leading zeros. Versioning begins when a data collection is first archived. Each subsequent update of the data collection increments the version number by 1. The version number is incremented when modifying or adding:  

  * Data files, including additions of datasets or supplemental data files, additional masking, increasing curation level, or resupplied datasets  
  * Documentation files  
  * SDA (Survey Documentation and Analysis) files  

Metadata-only updates to the data collection do not increment the version number. Changes to the version number require a textual summary to be added to Changes to Collection.  

**Examples:** 

```json
1
```

```json
2
```

## <a name="version_date"></a>2. Version Date         [Required]

**Description:** The date on which the current version of the data collection was released by ICPSR.

**Type**: `string`

**Format**: `date`

**Controlled Vocabulary:** N/A

**Usage Notes:** ICPSR automatically generates this date for data collection additions and updates. For metadata-only updates, the date remains unchanged.

**Examples:** 

```json
"2006-03-30"
```

```json
"2019-05-05"
```

## <a name="original_release_date"></a>3. Original Release Date         [Optional]

**Description:** The date on which the data collection was originally released by ICPSR.

**Type**: `string`

**Format**: `date`

**Controlled Vocabulary:** N/A

**Usage Notes:** ICPSR automatically generates the release date.

**Examples:** 

```json
"2001-02-07"
```

```json
"2020-08-12"
```

## <a name="study_title"></a>4. Study Title         [Required]

**Description:** The authoritative title of the data collection. A full title should include a descriptive string that captures what the data collection contains as well as the geographic scope of and the time period covered by the data collection.

**Type**: `string`

**Controlled Vocabulary:** N/A

**Usage Notes:** The Study Title includes three essential parts: the title proper, the geography, and the time period.  

Title Proper:  

  * The title proper is a descriptive string that captures what the data collection contains.   

  * The title proper uses title case: all major words are capitalized, while minor words are lowercased.  

  * For new studies, ICPSR starts with the title proper provided by the principal investigator. Most title propers are straightforward about their contents, such as the 'American Community Survey' or the 'Census of Law Enforcement Training Academies.' Some title propers include a more branded description, such as 'Bridge of Faith: Aim4Peace Community-Based Violence Prevention Project or Contents' and 'Contexts of Cyberbullying: An Epidemiologic Study using Electronic Detection and Social Network Analysis.'  

Geography:  

  * All titles include the data collection's geographic coverage. If the geographic coverage is already included in the title proper, it is not repeated.  

  * Cities are paired with state or province names that are spelled out (e.g., Portland, Oregon), unless the city names are unique or well-known.  

  * Studies with more than four geographic locations typically are summarized using, for example, '5 countries,' '8 German cities,' '20 U.S. states' instead of listing all locations.   

  * When listing multiple U.S. cites or states, 'U.S.' is used rather than 'United States' or 'American' (e.g., '5 U.S. states').  

  * Descriptors that do not have a distinct geographic area, such as 'communities' or 'regions', are not included in titles.   

  * If 'National,' 'American', 'Congressional' or 'Federal' is in the title, add '[United States]' (or, in rare situations, the appropriate other country) in brackets.  

Time Period:  

  * All titles include the data collection's time period, which reflects the time period that the data collection covers and should match the Study Time Period. For example, in the 'Uganda Elite Study, 1964-1968', it is assumed that the Ugandans were surveyed about events in 1964-1968, even if the actual data collection might not have taken place until later.  

  * If the time period is already included in the title proper, it is not repeated.  

  * For most studies, a single year or range of years is acceptable. Years are written as four digits, including when used in a range (e.g., '1999', '2001-2003', or '1999, 2010, 2015').  

  * Months are included only when part of ICPSR series that have multiple releases, which are otherwise identical, each year. In these cases, months are spelled out (e.g., 'September 2020' instead of '9/2020' or 'Sept. 2020').  

For updated studies, ICPSR uses the existing title in production, making changes as necessary to add new years or additional geographical locations. For studies that are part of an ICPSR series, titles remain consistent with the previous series studies.  

**Curator Notes:** ICPSR staff are empowered to change the dates in approved titles without metadata librarian approval when the data supports the change. Geography changes should be submitted for approval.    

**Examples:** 

```json
"Bridge of Faith: Aim4Peace Community-Based Violence Prevention Project, Kansas City, Missouri, 2014-2017"
```

```json
"Health and Relationships Project, United States, 2014-2015"
```

```json
"Targeted Interventions to Prevent Chronic Low Back Pain in High Risk Patients: A Multi-Site Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial (TARGET Trial), 4 U.S. cities, 2016-2019"
```

```json
"Aid Like A Paycheck (ALAP), Texas and California, 2014-2017"
```

## <a name="alternate_titles"></a>5. Alternate Titles         [Optional]

**Description:** The alternate name(s) or acronym(s) by which a data collection may be commonly referred.

**Type**: `array of string`

**Controlled Vocabulary:** N/A

**Usage Notes:** Alternate Title often takes the form of a shortened (by abbreviation or acronym) version of the official title.

#### <a name="principal_investigators_items_name"></a>8.1.1. Name

**Description:** The name of the entity primarily responsible for the data collection.

**Type**: `string`

**Controlled Vocabulary:** ICPSR utilizes VIAF ([https://viaf.org/](https://viaf.org/)) as its authority control source. The ICPSR Personal Names Authority List ([https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10002](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10002)) and Organizational Names Authority List ([https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10004](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10004)) can also be used, especially for organization names.

**Usage Notes:** The authority control for both personal and organizational names is the [Virtual International Authority File, or VIAF](https://viaf.org/), which links the various national authority files (that is, catalogs of authoritative names such as the [Library of Congress Name Authority File](https://authorities.loc.gov/)) into a single international collective. If a principal investigator does not have a VIAF record, another source is used to ensure their inputted name is accurate.  

For names of people:   

  * The First name can include any middle names or initials; the Last name can include any suffixes (such as 'II' or 'Jr.').   

  * There is no space between first and middle initials.  

  * Abbreviations are discouraged, especially 'et al.'  'Sr.' and 'Jr.' are allowed.    

For studies that are part of an ICPSR series, PIs remain consistent with the way the same PIs are listed in the previous series studies.    

**Curator Notes:** Years are not indicated when listing individual PIs, even if VIAF uses them to disambiguate between same-named PIs.

**Examples:** 

```json
"The New York Times"
```

```json
"James A. McCann"
```

```json
"United States Department of Justice. Office of Justice Programs. Bureau of Justice Statistics"
```

#### <a name="principal_investigators_items_affiliation"></a>8.1.2. Affiliation

**Description:** The organization with which an individual PI was affiliated at the time of a data collection's publication.

**Type**: `string`

**Controlled Vocabulary:** ICPSR utilizes VIAF ([http://viaf.org/](http://viaf.org/)) as its authority control source. The ICPSR Organization Names Authority List ([https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10004](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10004)) may also be used for Organization names.

**Usage Notes:** The authority control for organizational names is the [Virtual International Authority File, or VIAF](https://viaf.org/), which links the various national authority files (that is, catalogs of authoritative names such as the [Library of Congress Name Authority File](https://authorities.loc.gov/)) into a single international collective. If a principal investigator does not have a VIAF record, another source is used to ensure their inputted name is accurate.  

For names of organizations:  

  * If an organizational affiliation for a person is not know, 'Unknown' is listed in that principal investigator's (PI's) Organization.  

  * If the list of PIs includes multiple people affiliated with the same organization, that organization is repeated for each person.  

  * For organizational PIs, the higher level of an organization should be listed before the lower level, and levels should be separated by a period (e.g.,'University of Michigan. College of Literature, Science, and the Arts'). There is no period following the last level listed.  

  * Abbreviations are discouraged, except 'Inc.' and 'Co.' In particular, governmental PI's are spelled out completely (e.g., 'United States Department of Commerce' rather than 'U.S. Dept. of Commerce').  

  * 'The' is not included at the start of an organization name unless it is actually part of the official name (e.g., 'The New York Times' but not 'The National Institute of Justice').  

For studies that are part of an ICPSR series, PIs remain consistent with the way the same PIs are listed in the previous series studies.  

**Examples:** 

```json
"University of Michigan"
```

```json
"Harvard University. Medical School"
```

```json
"University of California, Irvine"
```

```json
"Urban Institute"
```

#### <a name="principal_investigators_items_order"></a>8.1.3. Order

**Description:** The order of importance for the PIs associated with the data collection -- typically provided to ICPSR by the lead PI. A value of '1' indicates the primary PI, '2' the second, and so forth.

## <a name="summary"></a>14. Summary         [Required]

**Description:** A full description or abstract of the data collection's subject matter or intellectual content. The main goal of the Summary is to give the user a clear sense of what the collection is about, including the purpose of the collection, the major topics covered, and what questions the principal investigators attempted to answer when they conducted the data collection.

**Type**: `string`

**Controlled Vocabulary:** N/A

**Usage Notes:** The main goal of the Summary is to give the reader a clear sense of what the data collection is about, including substantive information about the different parts of the data collection not adequately conveyed by the Fileset names or found elsewhere in the metadata.   

A listing of major variables or categories of variables with a few examples is also important. It is also salient to indicate the unit of analysis for the data collection, i.e., who or what is being studied: individuals, housing units, courts, criminal acts, etc. Most often the unit of analysis is the individual; where it is not, it is particularly important to make this clear.  

The Summary is written in the third person and avoids attempting to address issues of how the data might be used, who might be interested in the data, or any evaluative comments about the worth or usefulness of the data collection. The Summary uses past tense when describing the process of collecting the data and present tense when necessary, such as when describing the data (e.g., 'The MIDUS Refresher collection is split into two datasets.'). Numerals are used instead of spelling them out; if a number is spelled out for emphasis, the number is attached in parentheses (e.g. 'Two thousand (2,000)').  

**Examples:** 

```json
"In 2014, Chicago Public Schools, looking to reduce the possibility of gun violence among school-aged youth, applied for a grant through the National Institute of Justice. CPS was awarded the Comprehensive School Safety Initiative grant and use said grant to establish the 'Connect and Redirect to Respect' program. This program used student social media data to identify and intervene with students thought to be at higher risk for committing violence. At-risk behaviors included brandishing a weapon, instigating conflict online, signaling gang involvement, and threats towards others. Identified at-risk students would be contacted by a member of the CPS Network Safety Team or the Chicago Police Department's Gang School Safety Team, depending on the risk level of the behavior. To evaluate the efficacy of CRR, the University of Chicago Crime Lab compared outcomes for students enrolled in schools that received the program to outcomes for students enrolled in comparison schools, which did not receive the program. 32 schools were selected for the study, with a total of 44,503 students. Demographic variables included age, race, sex, and ethnicity. Misconduct and academic variables included arrest history, in-school suspensions, out-of-school suspensions, GPA, and attendance days."
```

```json
"The Health and Relationship Project is a study of both spouses in same-sex and different-sex marriages who were legally married and aged 35 to 65 at the time of data collection (2015). There are two parts of this study: a baseline questionnaire and a daily diary questionnaire completed for 10 consecutive days; both components were completed online and spouses were asked to complete the surveys separately. The baseline questionnaire asks participants about a number of topics related to marriage and health, including stress, health status and health behaviors, relationship quality, and how they have approached health problems in the past. The diary questionnaire asks participants a number of questions about the past 24 hours, including daily stress experiences, social interactions, and health behaviors."
```

## <a name="subject_terms"></a>15. Subject Terms         [Required]

**Description:** A controlled list of terms used for indexing purposes to indicate what topics a data collection reflects. Subject Terms serve to increase the collection's discoverability by topic.

**Type**: `array of string`

**Controlled Vocabulary:** Values from the ICPSR Subject Terms Thesaurus ([https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10001](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10001)) and the ICPSR Personal Names Authority List ([https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10002](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/10002)) are preferred. Non-thesaurus terms are considered for inclusion if provided.

**Usage Notes:** The Library of Congress Subject Terms ([https://authorities.loc.gov](https://authorities.loc.gov)) is referenced when adding new terms to the ICPSR Subject Thesaurus.

**Curator Notes:** Non-thesaurus terms can be submitted in the metadata editor and will be reviewed by the metadata librarian. If an ICPSR staff member submits a non-thesaurus term, the metadata librarian will gauge the necessity of this term, check it against the Library of Congress Subject Headings to see if a different related term should be used, and consider it for addition to the ICPSR thesaurus.

**Usage Notes:** Each geographic term's full hierarchy must be included:   

* For a U.S. city, the state and country are listed alongside (e.g., 'Los Angeles, California, United States').   
* Non-U.S. geographic subdivisions need not include hierarchical relations, with the specific exceptions of Canadian provinces and the countries within the United Kingdom.  

County-level information is typically not indicated. If a U.S. county is included, the state and 'United States' must be included as well.  

The Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names ([http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/index.html](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/index.html)) is referenced when adding new geographic names.  

**Curator Notes:** The metadata editor will automatically put this field in alphabetical order, regardless of hierarchy.

## <a name="study_purpose"></a>22. Study Purpose         [Optional]

**Description:** Describes the concept of the data collection in detail.

**Type**: `string`

**Controlled Vocabulary:** N/A

**Usage Notes:** The Study Purpose provides more specific information than the Summary field, including the data collection's objectives, intended achievements, and lists of questions it sought to answer. This field can also include historical or background information about the research project. As with the Summary, the text should be written in third person and avoid any commentary on the data collection's outcomes.

**Examples:** 

```json
"The purpose of this study is to advance understanding of the barriers and enablers associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) screening among Somali men ages 50-74 in Minnesota."
```

```json
"The purpose of the study's qualitative phase is to explore veterans' experiences by identifying factors that they believe caused or contributed to their contact with the criminal justice system."
```

```json
"The purpose of the study was to explore the impact of interventions by Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners/Sexual Assault Response Teams (SANE/SART) on the judicial process. The goal of this study was to test the efficacy of SANE/SART programs as a tool in the criminal justice system. The American Prosecutors Research Institute and Boston College tested the hypotheses that SANE/SART exams increase arrest and prosecution rates. In testing this hypothesis, the project team sought to answer five primary research questions: (1) Is the arrest rate higher in cases where a SANE/SART exam is performed as compared with cases in which no exam is performed?, (2) Is the indictment/charging rate higher in such cases?, (3) Are guilty pleas more likely to be entered in such cases, and are pleas likely to be to the existing charge or to a lesser charge?, (4) Is the conviction rate higher in such cases?, and (5) Is the sentence more severe in such cases? In addition, the project team examined the participation of victims in the criminal justice process and the types of services that were offered them. As a large portion of SANE/SART programs focus on understanding victims' reactions to sexual assault and ensuring proper treatment to minimize the chance of further trauma, a central hypothesis to be tested was that improved case outcomes may be a result of increased participation by the victim in the identification, apprehension, and prosecution of the perpetrator. Moreover, the level of services offered and provided to victims, particularly those related to prosecution would likely affect case outcomes as well. Both the victim's participation in the criminal justice system and specifics of SANE/SART services, including evidence collection, were considered in determining the true impact of SANE/SART interventions on case outcomes."
```

## <a name="study_design"></a>23. Study Design         [Optional]

**Description:** Describes the procedures the researchers used to contact subjects and/or to collect the data.

**Type**: `string`

**Controlled Vocabulary:** N/A

**Usage Notes:** The Study Design provides more detailed information than the Summary, including how surveys were prepared and administered, how interviews were conducted, or how the data were obtained and compiled, as well as information about deadlines and follow-ups to respondents.  

**Curator Notes:** It is acceptable to summarize information contained in study documentation and point users to that study documentation for more details. If the Summary already contains text that would be appropriate in Study Design, it is acceptable to duplicate that text.  

**Example:** 

```json
"Data on organizational culture in each of the 12 courts (Part 1) were obtained by administering the Court Culture Assessment Instrument (CCAI) to all judges with a felony criminal court docket and to all senior court administrators. A total of 224 respondents completed the questionnaire. The CCAI was used to assess five key dimensions of current court culture orientation: (1) dominant case management style, (2) judicial and court staff relations, (3) change management, (4) courthouse leadership, and (5) internal organization. The determination of what culture judges and court administrators desired to establish in the near future was also obtained through the application of the same instrument (CACI) as practitioners were asked to indicate the type of culture in each work area (or content dimension) they would like to see in their court in the next five years. Additionally, surveys were conducted of prosecuting attorneys (Part 2) and public defender attorneys (Part 3) to gauge their views on how well the courts in which they practice achieve the goals of access, fairness, and managerial effectiveness. Every prosecutor and public defender with two years or more experience in representing the state or criminal defendants in felony cases was asked to complete a questionnaire probing their thoughts on how well their court acted to promote access to records through availability and staff cooperation, treating litigants, witnesses, jurors and others fairly, and demonstrating concern for the rights and interests of others in the criminal trial process, including attorney and victims. A total of 334 prosecuting attorneys and 260 public defense attorneys completed the 46-item trial court process survey."

]
```

```json
[
    "The original National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Children and Young Adults 1979 (NLSY79) was a multi-stage, stratified random national sample. Sampling weights are available in the public-use datasets to adjust for minority oversamples and year-to-year attrition. There are mother and child specific weights. Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) were counties and independent cities. PSUs were stratified prior to sampling based on 9 Census divisions and 2 urban/rural classes.",
    "The initial Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) combined two independent samples: a cross-sectional, national sample (based on stratified multistage selection of the civilian noninstitutional population of the U.S.) and a national sample of low-income families. The cross-section sample was an equal probability sample of households in the 48 coterminous states designed to yield about 3,000 completed interviews. The second sample was selected from the Census Bureau's Survey of Economic Opportunity (SEO) using unequal selection probabilities. "

| *Option* | *Description* |  
|----------|---------------|  
| Cross-sectional | Data collected by observing subjects within the study period, without regard to changes over time. May include more than one collection event. Analysis of cross-sectional data often consists in comparing the differences and similarities among subjects. |  
| Cross-sectional ad-hoc follow-up | Data collected at one point in time to complete information collected in a previous cross-sectional study; the decision to collect follow-up data was not included in the original study design. |  
| Longitudinal | Data collected repeatedly over time to allow studying change in a population. At least some of the questions or modules are repeated over waves. Use the broad term when none of the subterms is suitable. |  
| Longitudinal: Cohort / Event-based | Data collected over time from the same cohort of respondents. The individuals in the cohort are connected in some way or have shared some significant experience within a given period. In some cases, the samples may differ between waves but are drawn from the same cohort. Examples: birth year, disease (clinical trials), common problem (intervention studies), education, employment, family formation, participation in an event. |  
| Longitudinal: Panel | Data collected over time from, or about, the same sample of respondents. Differs from cohort/event-based data in that the selection of respondents is not based on their being connected in some way or having shared some significant experience. |  
| Longitudinal: Panel: Continuous | Data collected from a panel of respondents on a regular basis. |  
| Longitudinal: Panel: Interval | Data collected from a panel of respondents only when information is needed. |  
| Longitudinal: Trend / Repeated Cross-section | Data collected from different samples or different groups of people from the same population at several points in time, using at least partly the same set of questions/variables. Conclusions are drawn for the population. Examples: European Social Survey (ESS), national longitudinal crime surveys. |  
| Time Series | Data collected repeatedly over time to study change in observations. These are typically "objective" measurements of phenomena that can be observed externally, as opposed to attitudes/opinions or feelings. Examples may include economic/financial indicators, natural/meteorological phenomena, vital statistics, etc. |  
| Time Series: Continuous | Measurements are taken at every instant in time. Examples: lie detectors, electrocardiograms, etc. |  
| Time Series: Discrete | Measurements are taken at (usually regularly) spaced intervals. Examples: macroeconomics (weekly share prices, monthly profits, sales); meteorology (hourly temperature); measurements of individuals (blood pressure, weight, height); sociology (crime figures, employment figures), etc. |

## <a name="extent_of_processing"></a>29. Extent of Processing         [Optional]

**Description:** Describes processing activities and checks performed on data collections by ICPSR curation staff.

**Type**: `array of enum (of string)`

**Usage Notes:**   

| *Option* | *Description* |  
|----------|---------------|  
| Checked for undocumented or out-of-date codes | Selected if the ICPSR curator checked at least half of the variables in the data collection for wild codes and corrected or reported in the codebook any wild codes discovered by these checks. |  
| Created online analysis version with question text | Selected if the ICPSR curator created online analysis version with question text. |  
| Created variable labels and/or value labels | Selected if the ICPSR curator created variable labels and/or value labels. |  
| Performed consistency checks | Selected if the ICPSR curator performed any of the following consistency checks on at least half of the variables in the data collection and corrected or reported in the codebook any inconsistencies discovered by these checks:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Checked to see that skip patterns in questionnaires were followed correctly.  <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Checked the logical consistency of response patterns across variables. |  
| Performed recodes and/or calculated derived variables | Selected if the ICPSR curator recoded at least one original variable in the data collection and/or produced at least one new variable derived from one or more original variables. The following kinds of recodes DO NOT qualify for this task:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Recodes performed for reasons of confidentiality. This type of recoding may be mentioned in other sections of the metadata description, usually in Restrictions or Collection Notes.  <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Recodes performed to correct errors uncovered by consistency checks.  <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Recodes performed to correct errors uncovered by checks for undocumented codes.  <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Recodes performed by standardized missing data codes.  <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- When a unique record identifier is created that is not derived from an original variable. |  
| Standardized missing values | Selected if the ICPSR curator standardized missing values for at least half of the variables in the data collection. Standardization of missing values means that all 'missing' responses are coded according to a fixed set of rules. There are various ways in which this standardization is typically applied. In some data collections, each kind of 'missing response' may be assigned the same code across all variables, e.g., 'inapplicable' cases may be coded -1 for all variables, 'don't know' may be coded -2, and 'no answer' may be coded -3. In other instances, standards may be specific to the type of variable involved, e.g., blanks may denote missing data for all alphabetic variables, codes -1, -2, and -3 may denote missing data for all dummy variables, and codes 7, 8, and 9 may represent missing data for all other variables. In yet other instances, standard codes may depend on the column width of each variable, e.g., 99 may denote 'no answer' for all two column variables and 999 may denote the same for all three column variables. |

## <a name="weight"></a>30. Weight         [Optional]

**Description:** A description of the criteria for using weights in the analysis of the data collection.

**Type**: `string`

**Controlled Vocabulary:** N/A

**Usage Notes:** Weight includes any information about weighting variables in the data, as well as any other weight information provided by the PI. If a weighting formula or coefficient was developed, provide this formula, define its elements, and indicate how the formula is applied to the data. It is acceptable to summarize information contained in documentation and refer users to that documentation for more information.

**Curator Notes:** For NIJ studies, 'Not applicable.' should be used if no information is available. For all other archives, this field is optional.

**Examples:** 

```json
"A weight variable with two implied decimal places has been included and must be used in any analysis."
```

```json
"Both the TransPop and Cisgender datasets have the same variable named WEIGHT as the weighting variable. The combination datasets have a set of three weight variables (WEIGHT_TRANSPOP, WEIGHT_CISGENDER, WEIGHT_CISGENDER_TRANSPOP). The results will be representative of the sample when the weight is applied. Pages 41 and 42 of the user guide contain instructions that detail how to apply the final sample weight using Stata or SPSS."
```

```json
"The 1996 NES dataset includes two final person-level analysis weights which incorporate sampling, nonresponse, and post-stratification factors. One weight (variable #4) is for longitudinal micro-level analysis using the 1996 NES Panel. The other weight (variable #3) is for analysis of the 1996 NES combined sample (Panel component cases plus Cross-section supplement cases). In addition, a Time Series Weight (variable #5) which corrects for Panel attrition was constructed. This weight should be used in analyses which compare the 1996 NES to earlier unweighted National Election Study data collections."

**Type**: `string`

**Controlled Vocabulary:** N/A

**Usage Notes:** The inclusion of a common scale should be identified in the documentation associated with this dataset and confirmed by variable names or labels.    

The scales can be cited either as a list or described in full sentences.   

If the questionnaire used has a finite list of responses (e.g., 'Always, Sometimes, Rarely, Never' or Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly Disagree'), it is acceptable for this field to note 'A Likert-type scale was used,' or 'Several Likert-type scales were used.' However, especially in situations where only Likert-type Scales were used, it is not required.  

**Curator Notes:** For NIJ studies, if there is no indication that scales are used, enter 'None' in this field. For all other archives, this field is optional.

**Examples:** 

```json
[
    "The baseline data collection included one scale - the CES-D index for maternal depression [Cole, J. C., Rabin, A. S., Smith, T. L., and Kaufman, A. S. (2004).

## <a name="geographic_unit"></a>34. Geographic Unit         [Optional]

**Description:** The smallest geographic unit used in the dataset.

**Type**: `string`

**Controlled Vocabulary:** N/A

**Usage Notes:** Geographic Unit is intended to represent specific, known geography -- e.g., county, census district, FIPS code, electoral district, and any other conveyor of specific geography that is represented by a variable.  

If the data do not include a geographic variable by which the data can be analyzed, this field is not indicated. If all the cases are from a single state, but the cases are not subdivided geographically within that state, then 'state' is not indicated.  

This field is only meant to convey specific, known, geography. If there is a variable indicating which testing site a survey was taken at, but the locations of the testing sites were masked by the PI, this field is likely not indicated.  

**Curator Notes:** For NIJ studies, enter 'None' if no geographic variables are present. For all other archives, this field is optional.
